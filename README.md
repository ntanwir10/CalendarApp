# CalendarApp

    A simple calendar app built using react native, native base.
    This app is compatible on both Android and iOS.
    
## This is just POC. The calendar and agenda components are built using react-native-calendars library. https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars    

# If you wish to try out this app, follow below steps.

1. download the repo or git clone.
2. npm install
3. This is a react-native init app. So, expo commands will not work. To run this app on emulator or physical device, run react-native run-android for Android or react-native run-ios for iOS.


## this is work under progress
